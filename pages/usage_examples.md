# Usage examples

We are working on several examples presenting how to use the Alphasense 
Core in various kinds of applications. Expect more demos coming soon.

Note that the sole purpose of the demos is to indicate usage 
scenarios of the Core Research using open-source software and not 
to provide product-ready or state-of-the-art results. 

To take a full advantage of the Core Research used for SLAM, we 
recommend the industry-ready positioning system by Sevensense, 
[Alphasense Position](https://www.sevensense.ch/products).

## Stereo demo

In this demo we show how you can use the front stereo pair to get a depth
map using block matching.

The demo can be found [here](https://github.com/sevensense-robotics/alphasense_stereo_demo).
